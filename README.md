tib-ntm-metadata-generator
===========================

This is a single HTML form which can be used to generate TIB NTM Schema 2.2 XML. Metadata is generated by populating text boxes and selecting values from drop-downs. The results can then be saved to a file. The main goal of this form was to create a tool which does not require any installation, extra libraries, or an application server, just download and go.
